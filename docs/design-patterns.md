## Design Patterns and Architectural Principles


- Separation of Concerns: This principle advocates for a separation between software components based on their responsibilities. Each part of a system should have a distinct responsibility. This leads to better maintainability and understandability of the system.
- Modularity: A complex system should be broken down into manageable modules. Each module should encapsulate a specific functionality and should be loosely coupled with other modules. This promotes better testing, maintainability, and reusability of the software.
- Abstraction: This principle encourages hiding complex implementations behind a simplified interface. The user or client only needs to understand the interface without worrying about the inner workings of the component. This aids in managing complexity and improving usability.
- Layered Architecture: This is a principle where the software is divided into layers, where each layer provides services to the layer above it and acts as a client to the layer below. This principle helps in structuring applications and promoting reusability.
- High Cohesion and Low Coupling: Cohesion refers to how closely the responsibilities of a module or component are related to each other. High cohesion means that a module or a class does one thing very well and does not try to take on many responsibilities. Coupling refers to the degree to which one class or module depends on another. Low coupling means that a change in one module will have minimal or no impact on other modules.
- Scalability: An architecture should be designed with future growth in mind. The system should be capable of handling increased demand with minimal impact on performance.
- Security: Architectural design should consider security at all levels, not just as an afterthought. This includes considerations like data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
- Performance and Efficiency: The architecture should be designed in a way that allows efficient execution of key system functionality and high performance.
- Interoperability: The ability for different systems to communicate and operate with each other. This is increasingly important with the rise of microservices and distributed systems.
- Fault Tolerance and Resilience: The architecture should be able to handle and recover from faults, whether they are hardware or software failures. This is usually achieved through redundancy and graceful degradation.
