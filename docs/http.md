### HTTP

HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the underlying protocol used for communication between a client (typically a web browser) and a server over the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is essential for the transmission of various resources such as HTML documents, images, videos, and more.

Here's an overview of what a frontend developer should know about HTTP:

Client-Server Model: HTTP follows a client-server model, where the client (e.g., a web browser) sends requests to the server, and the server responds with the requested resources or appropriate status codes.

Request Methods: HTTP defines several request methods, also known as verbs, which indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. The most commonly used methods include GET (retrieve a resource), POST (send data to the server), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource), and more. Each method has a specific purpose and usage.

URL and URI: Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address used to locate a resource on the web. It typically consists of the protocol (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), domain name (e.g., "example.com"), path (optional), and query parameters (optional). Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a broader term that includes URLs and other resource identifiers.

Headers: HTTP requests and responses contain headers that provide additional information about the request or response. Headers can include information such as content type, cache control, cookies, authentication credentials, and more. Frontend developers should understand commonly used headers and their purposes.

Status Codes: HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers sent by the server to indicate the status of a request. They provide information about whether a request was successful, redirected, or encountered an error. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and more. Understanding status codes helps frontend developers handle different scenarios and provide appropriate feedback to users.

Statelessness: HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning it does not maintain any memory of previous requests. Each request is treated as an independent transaction. This requires frontend developers to implement techniques like cookies, local storage, or session management to maintain user state across multiple requests.

Caching: HTTP supports caching to improve performance and reduce server load. By using caching headers like Cache-Control and ETag, developers can control how resources are cached by the browser, making subsequent requests faster.

HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the client and server. Frontend developers should understand the importance of HTTPS and ensure secure communication by using HTTPS wherever sensitive data is involved.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): CORS is a security mechanism implemented by browsers to control cross-origin requests. Frontend developers should be familiar with CORS and how to handle it when making requests to different domains or ports.

WebSockets: While HTTP is primarily a request-response protocol, WebSockets provide a bidirectional, full-duplex communication channel between the client and server. Frontend developers can leverage WebSockets for real-time communication and updates in web applications.

HTTP/2 - required SS
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over the internet. It defines how requests and responses should be formatted and transmitted, allowing the exchange of data and resources.

For a JavaScript developer, understanding HTTP is crucial as it forms the basis of how web applications interact with servers. When a JavaScript application sends an HTTP request, it typically expects a response containing data or instructions from the server. This data can be used to update the application's user interface dynamically or perform other operations.

HTTP/2.0 (commonly referred to as HTTP/2) is the next major version of the HTTP protocol, introduced in 2015. It was designed to address certain limitations of HTTP/1.1 and improve the efficiency of web communications. Here are some key differences between HTTP/2 and its predecessor:

Multiplexing: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection simultaneously. This eliminates the need for multiple connections, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

Binary Protocol: HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol instead of the text-based protocol used in HTTP/1.1. This change enables more efficient parsing and serialization of data, resulting in improved performance.

Header Compression: HTTP/2 includes header compression techniques, which significantly reduce the overhead of transmitting header information with each request and response. This helps reduce latency and improves network utilization.

Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces a server push mechanism, where the server can proactively send additional resources to the client before they are requested. This feature helps optimize the loading of web pages and improves performance.

Prioritization: HTTP/2 allows the client to assign priority to different resources, indicating their importance. This enables more efficient resource allocation and helps ensure critical resources are loaded first.

Overall, HTTP/2 aims to make web communication faster, more efficient, and more responsive. As a JavaScript developer, you can benefit from these improvements by leveraging the capabilities of HTTP/2 in your applications to enhance performance and user experience.
