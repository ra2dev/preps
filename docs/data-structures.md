## Data Structures
- Arrays: Indexed collection of elements with constant-time access to elements.
- Linked Lists: Linear collection of elements where each element points to the next element.
- Stacks: Linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Queues: Linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- Trees: Non-linear data structure with hierarchical relationships between elements.
- Binary Trees: Trees where each node can have at most two child nodes.
- Binary Search Trees: Binary trees with the property that the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
- Hash Tables: Data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to array indices for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.
- Graphs: Non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
- Heap: Tree-based data structure with the property that the parent node is either greater or smaller than its children.
- Trie: Tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys with common prefixes.
- Sets: Collection of distinct elements with no particular order.
- Maps: Collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
- Linked Hash Maps: Hash table with a linked list that maintains the insertion order of elements.
- Priority Queues: Queue where each element has a priority associated with it.
- Bit Manipulation: Techniques for performing operations on individual bits.
- Dynamic Programming: Problem-solving technique that uses previously computed solutions to optimize recursive algorithms.
- Big O Notation: Mathematical notation to describe the efficiency (time and space complexity) of algorithms.
- AVL Trees: Balanced binary search trees that ensure the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one.
- Red-Black Trees: Self-balancing binary search trees that ensure logarithmic time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.
- B-trees: Self-balancing search trees optimized for disk-based storage systems.
- Bloom Filters: Probabilistic data structures for efficient membership testing.
- Disjoint Sets: Data structure to track a partitioning of a set into disjoint subsets and perform operations like union and find.
- Skip Lists: Probabilistic data structure that allows for fast search, insert, and delete operations.
- Graph Traversals: Algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search for finding paths in graphs with weighted edges.
